## Day 21 â€“ BCD to Excess-3 Converter

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a BCD to Excess-3 code converter using Behavioral Modeling in Verilog.
Excess-3 is a non-weighted code used to express decimal numbers. It is obtained by adding 3 (0011) to the BCD number.

## Expected Output

BCD Input	Excess-3 Output

0000 (0)	0011 (3)
0001 (1)	0100 (4)
0010 (2)	0101 (5)
0101 (5)	1000 (8)
1001 (9)	1100 (12)
1010 (10)	XXXX (invalid)

## Learning Outcome

Understood Excess-3 code representation.
Learned how to implement BCD-based encoders using Behavioral Modeling.
Practiced testbench writing and waveform analysis.

Do you also want me to suggest the Day 22 topic now so you can plan ahead?
