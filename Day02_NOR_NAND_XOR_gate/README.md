# Day 2 ‚Äì NOR, XOR, NAND Gates

## ‚úÖ Description

This day includes simulations for three fundamental logic gates:
- NOR Gate
- XOR Gate
- NAND Gate

Each gate has its own RTL module and testbench file. Simulations were done using EDA Playground, and waveform files (dump_*.vcd) are included.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ NOR Gate
*Expression*: Y = ~(A | B)

| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ XOR Gate
*Expression*: Y = A ^ B

| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ NAND Gate
*Expression*: Y = ~(A & B)

| A | B | Y |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |
