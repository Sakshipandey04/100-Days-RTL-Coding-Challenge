# T Flip-Flop to D Flip-Flop Conversion

## Introduction

A flip-flop is a basic memory element in digital electronics.
Sometimes, we need to implement one type of flip-flop using another.
This document explains how to **realize a D flip-flop using a T flip-flop**.

## ðŸ”¹ Characteristic Equations

* **D Flip-Flop:**

$$
Q_{next} = D
$$

* **T Flip-Flop:**

$$
Q_{next} = T \oplus Q
$$

## ðŸ”¹ Conversion Requirement

To make a T flip-flop behave like a D flip-flop, we must find the expression of **T** in terms of **D** and **Q**.

From above:

$$
D = Q_{next} = T \oplus Q
$$

$$
T = D \oplus Q
$$

## Excitation Table

| Present State (Q) | Next State (Q<sub>next</sub>) | Required T |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| 0                 | 0                             | 0          |
| 0                 | 1                             | 1          |
| 1                 | 0                             | 1          |
| 1                 | 1                             | 0          |

##  Conclusion

* The **excitation table** shows that the required input to the T flip-flop depends on the difference between the present and next state.
* The derived expression is:

$$
T = D \oplus Q
$$

* Therefore, connecting the input of the T flip-flop to **D âŠ• Q** makes the T flip-flop behave exactly like a D flip-flop

Would you like me to also prepare a **diagram-based README version** (with logic gate representation of the conversion)?
